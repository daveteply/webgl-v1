# WebGL v1

An application utilizing the [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework and [three.js](https://threejs.org/) to learn more about object graphs and 3D object interactivity.

See [demo](https://daveteply.github.io/webgl-v1?v=21)! Rows of shapes can be "rotated" by dragging let and right. Press a color to match surrounding colors. Give it a try!
